              <p className="text-justify tracking-tight text-zinc-600 text-lg">
                A Work Permit in Canada is a legal authorization that allows
                foreign nationals to work in the country for a specific
                employer, in a specific job, and for a designated period. Work
                permits are a critical pathway for individuals seeking to gain
                valuable work experience in Canada, contribute to the economy,
                and explore potential pathways to permanent residency.

                  Also known as a closed work permit, this type ties the permit
                  holder to a specific employer. The application typically
                  requires a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from the
                  employer.

                  Allows the holder to work for any employer in Canada, with
                  some exceptions. Common examples include the Post-Graduation
                  Work Permit (PGWP) and permits for spouses of international
                  students or skilled workers.
