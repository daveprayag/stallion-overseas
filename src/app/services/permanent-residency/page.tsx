              <p className="text-justify tracking-tight text-zinc-600 text-lg">
                Permanent Residency (PR) in Canada is a highly sought-after
                status that allows individuals to live, work, and study in
                Canada indefinitely. As a Permanent Resident, you have many of
                the same rights as Canadian citizens, including access to
                healthcare, social services, and the ability to apply for
                Canadian citizenship after meeting certain residency
                requirements. PR status can be obtained through various
                immigration programs, each designed to attract skilled
                professionals, entrepreneurs, and family members to Canada.
