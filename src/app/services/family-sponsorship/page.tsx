                Family Sponsorship in Canada is a vital immigration program that
                allows Canadian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor
                their close family members for permanent residency. This program
                underscores Canada’s commitment to family reunification,
                enabling families to live together and build their futures in
                one of the world’s most welcoming countries.
